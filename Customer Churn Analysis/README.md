# 📊 Customer Churn Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing customer churn using data science techniques.  
The goal is to understand why customers leave and how businesses can take action to improve retention.

## 🔍 Project Overview
Customer churn is a critical problem for businesses, as retaining existing customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.  
In this project, I performed **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, visualized churn patterns, and derived insights to identify factors contributing to churn.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python** 🐍  
- **Libraries:** pandas, matplotlib, seaborn  
- **Jupyter Notebook**

## 📂 Workflow
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** – Handling missing values and preparing data.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Understanding distributions, correlations, and trends.  
3. **Visualization** – Graphs & charts to highlight customer behavior.  
4. **Insights** – Key findings to help reduce churn.

## 📈 Key Insights
- Customers with shorter tenure are more likely to churn.  
- High monthly charges increase the chances of churn.  
- Services like internet type and contracts play an important role in retention.
