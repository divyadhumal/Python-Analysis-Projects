# 🚖 Uber Data Analysis  

This project is about analyzing the **Uber rides dataset** to understand travel patterns and improve decision-making with the help of data.  

---

## ❓ Problem Statement  
The dataset was messy and not ready for analysis:  
- Contained missing values  
- Date and time columns were not in proper format  
- Needed insights on ride demand (time, category, frequency)  

---

## 🛠️ How I Solved It  
1. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Removed missing/duplicate values  
   - Converted datetime columns into usable format (day, hour, weekday)  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - **Line Chart** → To see trends in rides over time  
   - **Heatmap** → To check ride demand across hours and weekdays  
   - **Pie Chart** → To view distribution of rides by category  

---

## 💡 Why This Matters  
- Uber and similar platforms rely on demand forecasting 🚕  
- Clean and structured **data helps in building accurate insights**  
- Visualizations make it easy to identify **peak hours, busy days, and popular ride types**  

---

## 📈 Key Insights  
- Peak demand observed during **morning and evening rush hours**  
- Weekdays had consistently higher rides compared to weekends  
- Specific ride categories dominated overall usage  

---

## 🚀 Tools & Libraries  
- Python 🐍  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  

---

## 📂 How to Use  
1. Clone this repository  
2. Open `Uber_Data_Analysis.ipynb`  
3. Run the notebook to see cleaned dataset and visualizations
